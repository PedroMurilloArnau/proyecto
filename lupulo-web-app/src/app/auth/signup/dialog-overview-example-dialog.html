  <h3>Terms & Conditions</h3>
  <p>These terms and conditions relate to the sale of products through the Joseph Holt Beer Shop and do not relate to any separate terms and conditions in our pubs, competitions or other offers.

    By placing your order and using the website www.joseph-holt.com/shop you are agreeing to the terms and conditions set out below.
    
    Any personal information provided by you is confidential and will not be passed on to any other companies or third-party organisations not affiliated with the Joseph Holt online business.
    
    We reserve the right to amend these Terms and Conditions without notice at any time.</p>

  <h3>COVID-19</h3>
  <p>Please note due to the COVID-19 pandemic we are currently operating with a significantly reduced team.
     Therefore, delivery schedules, refunds, cancellations and any associated terms are subject to change.</p>

  <h3>Age Restrictions</h3>
  <p>Build features quickly with simple, declarative templates. Extend the template language with
    your own components and use a wide array of existing components. Get immediate Angular-specific
    help and feedback with nearly every IDE and editor. All this comes together so you can focus
    on building amazing apps rather than trying to make the code work.</p>

  <h3>Pricing & Product Availability</h3>
  <p>All prices shown are correct, however if an error does occur, we will contact you prior to your order being dispatched to confirm if you would like to proceed with your order at the correct price.

    We will make every effort to ensure every product is available and whilst we continue to supply all products listed online, there may be instances where products sell out. If this happens we will contact you to offer an alternative product or ask if you wish to wait until the product is back in stock.
    
    Our online retail business reserves the right to withdraw, discontinue or replace products online without notice. This applies to all alcoholic products, related merchandise and gift vouchers.
    
    All beer shop transactions are facilitated through our third-party payment supplier Stripe and as such can only accept online payment via Credit or Debit Card. Promotional codes or discount codes will be issued periodically which can be redeemed against products but cannot be exchanged for cash or monetary value. For more information on how your data is used by Stripe please visit their Privacy Policy https://stripe.com/gb/privacy</p>
